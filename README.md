# StudIP_Filename_Cleaner

When downloading several files in StudIP, every file is indexed like '[1]_Filename'. This is cringe. So I made a small script to remove the index of every file in the current repository.
This script also removes the file 'archive_filelist.csv' which always there and totally useless.
