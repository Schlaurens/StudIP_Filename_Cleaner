# StudIP_Filename_Cleaner

When downloading several files in StudIP, every file is indexed like '[1]_Filename'. This is cringe. So I made a small script to remove the index of every file in the working directory and it's subdirectories.
This script also removes the file 'archive_filelist.csv' which is always there and totally useless. **Be careful though**, this script deletes **every** file that's called 'archive_filelist.csv'.
